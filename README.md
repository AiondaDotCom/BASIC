# Aionda BASIC

**BASIC+** is a modern low-code programming language inspired by the clarity of classic BASIC, reimagined for the age of web apps, databases, and generative AI.

It enables developers and non-developers to build forms, logic, data flows, and AI-powered features with simple, readable instructions — without needing to worry about technical complexity like SQL, HTTP, or backend setup.

## 🚀 Features

- 📋 Declarative syntax inspired by BASIC
- 🧠 Built-in support for Generative AI (`ASK`, `EXEC`)
- 🗄️ Database actions without SQL
- 📬 E-mail sending built-in
- 🔁 Clear control structures: `IF`, `FOR EACH`, `STOP`
- 🧱 Form builder with auto-rendering
- ⚡ No setup, zero boilerplate

## 🧠 Example

```basic
REM Create form via AI
ASK "Create a form to calculate the area of a circle using radius as input" INTO circleForm

REM Generate logic for calculation
ASK "Generate the logic to calculate the area using INPUT.radius" INTO logic1

REM Execute logic in memory
EXEC logic1
